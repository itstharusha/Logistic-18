SECTION 1 — PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

1.1  PROJECT IDENTITY
─────────────────────
  Name         : Logistic 18
  Group Code   : Y2S2-WE-DS-G18
  Supervisor   : Dr. Kapila
  Team Size    : 6 members
  Stack        : MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) + Python FastAPI (ML)

1.2  PROBLEM STATEMENT
──────────────────────
  Modern logistics operations suffer from four core failure modes:

  (a) Supplier Risk Blind Spots
      - No proactive monitoring of supplier financial health.
      - No tracking of geopolitical exposure at country level.
      - Supplier degradation is discovered only after failures occur.

  (b) Shipment Delay Reaction Gap
      - Teams respond reactively after delays have already materialized.
      - No early-warning system exists to predict or flag delays in advance.
      - Carrier tracking is manual and not correlated with risk signals.

  (c) Inventory Stockout Risk
      - No predictive mechanism to foresee stock depletion before it happens.
      - Safety stock and reorder points are calculated manually or not at all.
      - Critical SKUs are not differentiated from standard stock in risk logic.

  (d) Isolated Alert Systems
      - Risk signals from suppliers, shipments, and inventory are siloed.
      - No unified correlation layer exists to detect cascading risk events.
      - Alert fatigue occurs because duplicate and low-priority alerts are
        not suppressed or intelligently escalated.

1.3  PROPOSED SOLUTION
──────────────────────
  A production-grade, multi-tenant, ML-powered Smart Logistics & Supply Chain
  Management System built on the MERN stack with a Python FastAPI ML
  microservice. The system:

  - Replaces reactive monitoring with proactive, predictive risk scoring.
  - Trains three separate XGBoost regression models (one per risk domain:
    Supplier, Shipment, Inventory) using 10,000-row stratified datasets each.
  - Delivers a unified risk score (0–100) with tier classification
    (Low / Medium / High / Critical) for every tracked entity.
  - Aggregates risk signals from all modules into a single correlated alert
    engine with severity ranking, auto-assignment, and escalation logic.
  - Provides role-based access control (RBAC), audit trails, and analytics
    dashboards with export capability.

1.4  OBJECTIVES
───────────────
  - Multi-tenant logistics monitoring with strict organisation-level data
    isolation (cross-tenant access architecturally impossible).
  - Supplier risk evaluation with historical performance tracking (24-month
    minimum retention).
  - Real-time shipment delay detection and tracking via carrier APIs
    (FedEx, UPS, DHL) polled every 15 minutes.
  - Inventory exposure analysis and stockout prediction using 30/60/90-day
    demand forecasts.
  - Unified ML-based risk scoring service using XGBoost (replaces legacy
    rule-based alert agents).
  - Severity-ranked alert generation with escalation workflows and SLA
    enforcement.
  - What-if scenario simulation engine for supply chain risk planning.
  - Mitigation recommendation generation attached to each risk alert.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular per-permission enforcement.
  - Immutable audit trail for compliance and forensics.
  - Analytics dashboards with drill-down, KPI tracking, and export (CSV/PDF).

2.1  HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
──────────────────────────────────────
  The system follows a 4-tier distributed architecture:

  │  MongoDB Atlas             │     │  Python FastAPI                 │
  │  Replica Set               │     │  XGBoost Models (.joblib)       │
  │  Multi-tenant Isolation    │     │  /predict/supplier              │
  │  TTL Indexes               │     │  /predict/shipment              │
  └────────────────────────────┘     │  /predict/inventory             │
                                     │  /health                        │
                                     └────────────────────────────────┘

  Component Communication:
  - Frontend polls backend REST API every 30 seconds for dashboard refresh.
  - Backend calls ML microservice synchronously on entity creation/update
    (POST to /predict/* endpoints).
  - Backend reads/writes all persistent state to MongoDB Atlas.
  - ML service is stateless — it loads models at startup and serves
    predictions without touching the database directly.
  - External carrier APIs (FedEx/UPS/DHL) are polled by a backend cron
    job (Node-Cron) every 15 minutes.

2.2  BACKEND ARCHITECTURE
─────────────────────────
  Runtime     : Node.js
  Framework   : Express.js
  Pattern     : Layered Architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)

  Layer Responsibilities:
    Controller  — Receives HTTP requests, validates input, delegates to service.
    Service     — Contains business logic, orchestrates ML calls, fires alerts.
    Repository  — Abstracts all MongoDB queries; only layer touching Mongoose.

  Middleware Stack (executed in order per request):
    1. logging       — Logs all incoming requests with timestamps.
    2. auth          — Verifies JWT access token; rejects if expired/invalid.
    3. RBAC          — Checks user role permissions for the specific route.
    4. validation    — Validates request body/params against schema (Joi/Yup).
    5. controller    — Actual route handler execution.
    6. errorHandler  — Centralized error formatting and HTTP response codes.

  Authentication:
    - JWT Access Token: 15-minute expiry.
    - JWT Refresh Token: 7-day expiry, rotation on every reuse.
    - Refresh token stored in MongoDB; immediately invalidated on reuse attempt
      (detects token theft).
    - All tokens scoped to userID and orgID for multi-tenant isolation.

  Background Jobs (Node-Cron):
    - Carrier API polling: every 15 minutes (shipment status sync).
    - ML risk rescoring: every 4 hours (supplier risk recalculation).
    - Alert escalation checker: periodic (SLA breach detection).
    - MongoDB TTL job: auto-expires stale audit log entries per config.

2.3  FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE
──────────────────────────
  Framework   : React (SPA — Single Page Application)
  State Mgmt  : Redux Toolkit
  Routing     : Role-Based Routes (unauthorized routes redirect to login)
  Charts      : Chart.js (open source, no licensing cost)
  Polling     : 30-second interval polling for dashboard data refresh

  Key Frontend Principles:
  - Role-based route guards: each route checks user role before rendering.
  - Redux slices per module (supplier, shipment, inventory, alerts, reports).
  - All API calls use JWT access token from Redux store; refresh handled
    transparently via an Axios interceptor.
  - No server-side rendering assumed (SPA with client-side routing).

2.4  DATABASE STRUCTURE
───────────────────────
  Database    : MongoDB Atlas (Replica Set for high availability)
  ODM         : Mongoose

  Multi-Tenancy Strategy:
  - Every document includes an `orgId` field.
  - All queries are scoped with `{ orgId: req.user.orgId }` at repository
    layer — cross-tenant data access is architecturally impossible.

  TTL Indexes:
  - Audit log collections have TTL indexes for automatic expiry of old logs.
  - Alert cooldown tracking documents use TTL for automatic window reset.

================================================================================
SECTION 3 — SYSTEM FLOW
================================================================================

3.1  END-TO-END PROCESS FLOW
─────────────────────────────

  [A] USER AUTHENTICATION FLOW
  ─────────────────────────────
  User submits credentials
    → Backend validates email/password (bcrypt compare)
    → Issues Access Token (15 min JWT) + Refresh Token (7-day JWT)
    → Refresh token stored in DB
    → Frontend stores tokens in Redux / memory
    → Subsequent requests attach Access Token in Authorization header
    → On expiry, frontend sends Refresh Token to /auth/refresh
    → Backend validates, rotates refresh token, issues new Access Token
    → On reuse detection: all tokens invalidated (security breach flag)

  [B] SUPPLIER RISK SCORING FLOW
  ───────────────────────────────
  Org Admin registers a supplier (name, country, category, etc.)
    → Backend saves supplier document to MongoDB
    → Backend calls ML Service: POST /predict/supplier
        Input features (12):
          onTimeDeliveryRate, financialScore, defectRate, disputeFrequency,
          geopoliticalRiskFlag, totalShipments, averageDelayDays,
          daysSinceLastShip, activeShipmentCount, categoryRisk
        Output: riskScore (0–100), riskTier, recommendations
    → Backend stores riskScore, riskTier, explanation in supplier document
    → Backend appends entry to riskScoreHistory[]
    → If riskTier is HIGH or CRITICAL:
        → Alert Service creates alert document with severity mapping
        → Alert auto-assigned to Risk Analyst role in that org
        → Dashboard updated within 30 seconds (via frontend polling)
    → Background cron re-scores all suppliers every 4 hours automatically

  [C] SHIPMENT TRACKING & DELAY DETECTION FLOW
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  Logistics Operator registers shipment (carrier, origin, dest, ETA)
    → Backend saves shipment (status: Registered)
    → Node-Cron polls selected carrier API every 15 minutes
    → On each poll: updates shipment status and computes etaDeviationHours
    → If etaDeviationHours > 2:
        → Status transitions to Delayed
        → Backend calls ML Service: POST /predict/shipment
            Input features (10):
              etaDeviationHours, weatherLevel (encoded), routeRiskIndex,
              carrierReliability, trackingGapHours, shipmentValueUSD,
              daysInTransit, supplierRiskScore, isInternational,
              carrierDelayRate
            Output: riskScore, riskTier, recommendations
        → SHAP values computed by explainability service
        → Human-readable explanation generated and stored
        → Alert fired with delay magnitude severity mapping:
            < 4h delay    → Low
            4–12h delay   → Medium
            12–24h delay  → High
            > 24h delay   → Critical
    → On delivery confirmation:
        → Status → Delivered → Closed
        → Supplier's onTimeDeliveryRate recalculated automatically

  [D] INVENTORY RISK & FORECASTING FLOW
  ──────────────────────────────────────
  Inventory Manager registers/updates SKU stock levels
    → Backend calculates safety stock and reorder point automatically
    → Backend calls ML Service: POST /predict/inventory
        Input features (12):
          currentStock, averageDailyDemand, leadTimeDays, demandVariance,
          supplierRiskScore, safetyStock, reorderPoint, incomingStockDays,
          pendingOrderQty, isCriticalItem
        Output: riskScore, riskTier, recommendations
    → 30/60/90-day demand forecasts generated
    → If currentStock ≤ reorderPoint:
        → Reorder alert triggered (severity based on riskTier + isCriticalItem)
        → pendingOrderQty tracked to reduce false-positive risk during restock

  [E] ALERT LIFECYCLE FLOW
  ──────────────────────────
  Alert created (from ML prediction threshold breach)
    → Cooldown check: if duplicate alert for same entity within cooldown
      window exists → suppress new alert
    → Severity assigned (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
    → Auto-assigned to correct role (Risk Analyst / Logistics Operator /
      Inventory Manager) based on entityType
    → Assigned user receives notification
    → SLA timer starts
    → If not acknowledged within SLA period → Alert escalated
    → Assigned user acknowledges alert (status: Acknowledged)
    → User resolves alert with note (who, how, when recorded)
    → Audit log entry created for all state transitions

  [F] REPORT GENERATION FLOW
  ───────────────────────────
  Risk Analyst or Org Admin requests report
    → Backend queues report generation job
    → MongoDB aggregation pipeline runs across supplier/shipment/inventory
      collections for the requested date window (up to 90 days)
    → KPIs computed: supply chain risk score, delayed rate %, avg delivery
      time, stockout risk index
    → pdfkit or exceljs generates file server-side
    → File URL stored in reports collection
    → Frontend downloads file on completion (< 10s for 90-day window)

3.2  DATA FLOW BETWEEN COMPONENTS
──────────────────────────────────

  Frontend (React)
      ↕ REST API (JWT) every 30s poll
  Backend (Node/Express)
      ↕ Mongoose queries (orgId-scoped)
  MongoDB Atlas
      ↕ HTTP POST (internal, synchronous)
  ML Service (Python FastAPI)
      [stateless — no DB access]

  External Data IN:
  Carrier APIs → Node-Cron → Backend → MongoDB (shipment status updates)

  Data OUT:
  Backend → pdfkit/exceljs → file buffer → Frontend download

3.3  SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS (CRITICAL PATH)
────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. User logs in → JWT issued
  2. Frontend loads dashboard (initial GET requests)
  3. Org Admin creates/updates supplier/shipment/inventory entity
  4. Backend persists entity to MongoDB
  5. Backend calls ML microservice synchronously (POST /predict/*)
  6. ML service returns riskScore + riskTier + recommendations (< 50ms)
  7. Backend stores prediction result back to entity document
  8. Alert Service evaluates if alert threshold is breached
  9. If breach: alert document created, assigned, notification sent
  10. Frontend polls (30s) and renders updated risk scores and alerts
  11. Cron jobs run in background: carrier polling (15 min), re-scoring (4h),
      escalation checks (configurable SLA period)
  12. Audit log written on every state-changing operation

3.4  AUTOMATION LOGIC
──────────────────────
  Automation Trigger           Interval    Action
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Supplier risk re-scoring     4 hours     Call /predict/supplier for all
                                           active suppliers; update scores
  Carrier API polling          15 min      Sync shipment status from
                                           FedEx/UPS/DHL; detect delays
  Alert escalation check       Per SLA     If alert unacknowledged beyond
                                           SLA → escalate severity
  Alert cooldown reset         Per TTL     MongoDB TTL auto-removes cooldown
                                           documents, re-enabling new alerts
  Inventory reorder check      On update   If stock ≤ reorder point → trigger
                                           reorder alert automatically
  Supplier perf. update        On delivery Auto-recalculate onTimeDeliveryRate
                                           when shipment closes

SECTION 9 — DATASET ANALYSIS & ML MODEL SPECIFICATION
================================================================================

9.1  SUPPLIER RISK DATASET
───────────────────────────
  File    : supplier_risk_dataset.csv
  Rows    : 10,000 (stratified training set)
  Features: 12 (10 input + riskScore + riskTier)
  Target  : riskScore (continuous 0–100), riskTier (classification)

  riskTier  : low=2821, medium=3378, high=1306, critical=2495

  Tier Distribution Note: Dataset is reasonably stratified across tiers
  (2,500 rows per tier target as stated in proposal is approximately met).

9.2  INVENTORY RISK DATASET
────────────────────────────
  File    : inventory_risk_dataset.csv
  Rows    : 10,000 (stratified training set)
  Features: 12 (10 input + riskScore + riskTier)
  Target  : riskScore (continuous 0–87.31), riskTier (classification)

  Feature Details:

  riskTier  : low=4782, medium=2607, high=1782, critical=829

  Note: Inventory risk scores cap at ~87 (no critical-tier score reaches 100),
  and the dataset is skewed toward low risk — likely reflecting that most
  SKUs are adequately stocked. This should be considered in model evaluation.

9.3  SHIPMENT RISK DATASET
───────────────────────────
  File    : shipment_risk_dataset.csv
  Rows    : 10,000 (stratified training set)
  Features: 12 (10 input + riskScore + riskTier)
  Target  : riskScore (continuous 0–100), riskTier (classification)

  Feature Details:

  supplierRiskScore     Float    0.01–99.99          Linked supplier risk score
  isInternational       Int      0 or 1              Binary: cross-border flag
  carrierDelayRate      Float    0.01–60.00          % of carrier's delayed shipments

  Label Statistics:
  riskScore : min=1.80, max=97.16, mean=46.02, stdev=30.84
  riskTier  : low=3943, medium=2379, high=1277, critical=2401

  Note: Shipment risk has a bimodal-like distribution (many low-risk and
  many critical-risk shipments). This may reflect that shipments are either
  on track or severely delayed — few in the "warning zone." This should
  inform model calibration.

9.4  ML MODEL TARGETS & EVALUATION CRITERIA
─────────────────────────────────────────────
  Model            Features   Algorithm   Target R²   RMSE Target
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Supplier Risk    12         XGBoost     > 0.92      < 5 pts
  Shipment Risk    10 (+enc)  XGBoost     > 0.92      < 5 pts
  Inventory Risk   12         XGBoost     > 0.92      < 5 pts

  Training Split: 80% train / 10% validation / 10% test (held-out)
  Rows/tier target: ~2,500 per tier for balanced training

  Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, 5-fold CV):
    n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, subsample, early_stopping_rounds
    Each model tuned independently (optimal params differ per entity type)

  Model Files:
    supplier_model.joblib, shipment_model.joblib, inventory_model.joblib
    Backup: models/backup/ directory for instant rollback

  Explainability:
    SHAP values computed per prediction (not just global averages)
    Top 3 features per prediction surfaced as human-readable explanation
    Stored in MongoDB alongside riskScore and riskTier


================================================================================
SECTION 10 — ASSUMPTIONS (INFERRED FROM CONTEXT)
================================================================================

  ASSUMPTION-01 [Authentication]:
    The login page is the entry point for all users. No social/OAuth login
    is implemented — credentials only (email + password).

  ASSUMPTION-02 [Organisation Creation]:
    A super-admin role or platform onboarding flow exists outside the
    main app to create new organisation records. OrgAdmins cannot create
    new organisations — only manage within their own.

  ASSUMPTION-03 [What-if Simulator]:
    The scenario simulation engine sends feature vectors with modified
    values to the ML /predict/* endpoints and renders the hypothetical
    score in a side-by-side comparison. No separate ML model is needed.

  ASSUMPTION-04 [Notification Delivery]:
    In-app notifications are the primary channel. Email or SMS
    notifications are a potential extension but not confirmed in the
    proposal. The notification bell in the UI is confirmed.

  ASSUMPTION-05 [Geopolitical Risk Data]:
    The geopoliticalRiskFlag is manually set by the Org Admin during
    supplier registration (based on country selection). A future
    enhancement could auto-set this via a third-party geopolitical risk
    API, but this is not in scope.

  ASSUMPTION-06 [Carrier API Keys]:
    FedEx, UPS, and DHL sandbox API keys are configured per organisation
    in the Settings module. Production credentials would be org-specific.

  ASSUMPTION-07 [Forecast Algorithm]:
    The 30/60/90-day forecasts are generated using the XGBoost inventory
    model's predictions projected forward, potentially with simple moving
    average or exponential smoothing as a secondary method. This is not
    fully specified in the proposal.

  ASSUMPTION-08 [Alert SLA Configuration]:
    The SLA period for alert escalation is configurable per organisation
    (likely set in the Settings module by Org Admin).

  ASSUMPTION-09 [Shipment Value Normalization]:
    Given shipmentValueUSD ranges from ~$1K to ~$500K in the dataset,
    the feature is likely log-normalized before passing to the XGBoost
    model to prevent scale dominance.

  ASSUMPTION-10 [Model Presentation Layer]:
    The ML microservice is not directly accessible from the internet.
    It runs on an internal Docker network and is only reachable by
    the Node.js backend service.

  ASSUMPTION-11 [Inventory Note on riskScore Cap]:
    The inventory riskScore caps at 87.31 in the dataset (not reaching
    100). This may be intentional in dataset generation, reflecting that
    pure inventory risk rarely reaches absolute maximum without
    compounding supplier risk — which is already an input feature.

  ASSUMPTION-12 [FEATURE_ORDER Enforcement]:
    feature_config.py defines a canonical list of features in a fixed
    order. Both the training script and the FastAPI inference endpoint

SECTION 11 — SYSTEM SUMMARY (DEVELOPER-FACING TECHNICAL OVERVIEW)
================================================================================

  Logistic 18 is a multi-tenant, ML-powered supply chain risk management
  platform built on the MERN stack with a Python FastAPI ML microservice.
  It targets logistics organisations that need proactive, predictive
  risk monitoring across three domains: supplier reliability, shipment
  delays, and inventory stockouts.

  ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY:
  The system follows a clean 4-tier architecture: React SPA frontend →
  Node/Express REST API backend → MongoDB Atlas database, with a
  sidecar Python FastAPI ML service. The backend enforces a strict
  Controller→Service→Repository pattern with a 6-layer middleware
  stack. Authentication is stateless JWT with refresh token rotation.
  Multi-tenancy is achieved via orgId field scoping at the repository
  layer — not at the application layer — making cross-tenant leaks
  architecturally impossible.

  ML PIPELINE SUMMARY:
  Three independent XGBoost regression models are trained on 10,000-row
  stratified datasets each (supplier, shipment, inventory). Models are
  serialised to .joblib and loaded into FastAPI at startup. Predictions
  are served in < 50ms. SHAP values are computed per prediction for
  explainability. All features are pre-processed through a canonical
  FEATURE_ORDER pipeline (encoding, normalisation) defined in
  feature_config.py. Models are tuned independently via GridSearchCV
  with 5-fold cross-validation targeting R² > 0.92 and RMSE < 5 pts.
  A /health endpoint validates all 3 models are loaded before the
  service accepts traffic. Rollback is instant via models/backup/.

  RISK SCORING LOGIC:
  Risk scores are continuous (0–100), mapped to 4 tiers:
  Low (0–30), Medium (31–60), High (61–80), Critical (81–100).
  Supplier scores refresh every 4 hours automatically. Shipment scores
  are computed on each carrier API poll when deviation > 2h. Inventory
  scores are computed on every stock update. Human-readable explanations
  (top 3 SHAP features) are stored in MongoDB and surfaced in the UI.

  ALERT ENGINE SUMMARY:
  Alerts are generated automatically from ML output threshold breaches.
  Duplicate suppression is implemented via cooldown windows using MongoDB
  TTL documents. Alerts are auto-assigned by entityType→role mapping.
  Unacknowledged alerts escalate automatically after a configurable SLA
  period. All alert lifecycle events are written to an immutable audit log.

  DEVELOPER ENTRY POINTS:
  Backend  : Node.js / Express — routes → controllers → services →
             repositories → Mongoose models
  ML Svc   : Python FastAPI — main.py (endpoints), feature_engineering.py
             (preprocessing), feature_config.py (FEATURE_ORDER),
             evaluate.py (metrics), explainability.py (SHAP),
             hyperparameter_tuning.py (GridSearchCV)
  Frontend : React SPA — Redux Toolkit slices per module, Chart.js
             for visualisation, role-gated routes, 30s polling
  Database : MongoDB Atlas — 8 core collections, orgId-scoped queries,
             TTL indexes on audit logs and alert cooldown documents
  Infra    : Docker (ML service), MongoDB Atlas Free Tier (dev),
             Node-Cron (scheduled jobs), FedEx/UPS/DHL sandbox APIs
